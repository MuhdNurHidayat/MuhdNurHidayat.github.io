Hello everyone... I'm muhdnurhidayat a.k.a MNH48... I just knew about Discord so I'm not really familiar with the app yet but I want to get more info on LoveLive so I searched the Discord link and came here~~

## My background
About my name, I'm usually known as MNH48 in anime community because it's my website URL (mnh48.com) and I've made Malay subtitles released under that name (I don't distribute any videos, only text subtitle file) but I'm more commonly known as muhdnurhidayat in game community because it's my steam name. MNH48 is combination of the first words from my given names (**M**uhd **N**ur **H**idayat) and my lucky number 48.

Some people thought I use the number 48 because I'm fan of AKB48 but I only know about AKB48 a few years after I decided 48 as my lucky number. It started in computer lab in form 2 (9th grade) when I stupidly asks the teacher "why don't we create 48-bit windows and program if 32-bit windows can't run 64-bit programs and vice-versa?" ("vice versa" refering to fact that some 32-bit programs are unstable in 64-bit windows) and 48-bit there was result of (32+64)/2 = 48 ...

I'm from Malaysia :flag_my: so my timezone is UTC+8 which is just an hour behind Japan... If you asked where it is, it's just above Singapore...

## What about anime?
New anime that I'm currently watching is just LoveLive! Sunshine!! but that's also not really follow schedule as I'm quite busy with my study (I'm taking bachelor now, and internet here is very bad that I had to depend on my mobile data to survive)... I usually watch on AbemaTV, if I can't make it to the time it shows then I wait for the rebroadcast as AbemaTV is rebroadcasting it everyday at different times.

Other than that, I don't watch any newer anime. I'm just rewatching all offline animes that I have and crying for the money I need to spend to get internet working here. For those offline animes, I'm rewatching BanG_Dream!, K-ON!, THE iDOLM@STER, Hibike! Euphonium, Baka to Test to Shoukanjuu, Oregairu and others.

## What about games, you say?
LoveLive-wise, I did played LLSIF (JP server) before my game-specific phone broken, but since it's not sent for repair yet (because I don't have money for repair, yet) and playing it on BlueStack on Windows is bad (lagging), I've stopped playing LLSIF for a while. 

As for Windows games that I play, just right click at my name, then click on Profile, you would see a link to my steam account, you could see what games I play because I always run my game from steam client even if it's not steam-provided games...

Though most of the time, I play Minetest on Windows, which is an open-source C++ based voxel game inspired from Infiniminer and Minecraft, originally developed for Linux before it is made available in Windows, Mac and Android. There's also unofficial iOS app. Do note that Minetest itself is **not** cloning Minecraft but since Minetest is a modular game, there are people who _uses Minetest's engine_ to make mods that turns Minetest into Minecraft clones, such example are Buildcraft, Multicraft and MineClone.

## Hobby
My hobby is writing, reading, translating, listening and watching. I wrote many stuffs on the now-closed blog and I planned to move those stuffs to my website but didn't have time to do so yet. I loves reading that I have so many comics lying around my dormitory room. Since I want to support the comic author, I only buy original comics and translation manga released by trusted local comic house such as Kadokawa Gempak Starz Sdn Bhd. I loves listening to musics and I could be said to be one with music. I used to be listening MP3 on my phone all day long but now I'm more to listening musics on my laptop (FLAC, anyone?) as I need to do other things at the same time (such as assignments). I loves watching anime and movies that there are time I went for a long journey just to watch movie. (read [here](http://en.mnh48.com/2017/03/my-experience-watching-two-anime-movie.html) )

I also loves translating that I've been involved in translating English/Chinese to Malay for many softwares, websites and plugins. I also do English to Chinese translations if the required translation is not too complicated. I also do some Japanese to English/Malay/Chinese basic translations as I've indirectly learnt Japanese from the times I've been watching dual-subtitled anime. Since the dual-subtitle is Japanese and Chinese, I get to know some kanji and stuffs too, and learnt some relations between Chinese words and Japanese kanji (not all Japanese kanji are equals to Chinese words). English is my third language after Malay and Chinese, but I've passed national university english test at band 4 (equivalent to IELTS band 6) so it's safe to say I could understand and respond correctly in English.

## All in all
Nice to meet you all and I hope to get along with you...
